    <string name="ContextElements"> Elements are fundamental substances that cannot be broken down into simpler substances. They are categorized as metals and nonmetals based on their properties. Metals are characterized by their conductivity, malleability, and ductility.\n
        \nOnly 7 elements are found as diatomic molecules in nature: H2, N2, O2, F2, Cl2, Br2, I2; the other elements are monatomic. Chemical symbols are abbreviations used to denote the elements.\n
        \nExample: \nH = Hydrogen, He = Helium, Li = Lithium
</string>

    <string name="Electrons">Electrons are negatively charged subatomic particles discovered by Thomson in 1897 by deflecting cathode rays (electrons) through electric and magnetic fields. The electron has a negative charge and is located in shells that orbit the nucleus.\n
        \nMillikan\'s oil drop experiment provided a more precise measurement of the electron\'s charge, allowing for the determination of the absolute charge of the electron: e = 1.602177 x 10-19 C.\n

        X: Element symbol representing a specific element.
        \nZ: Atomic number = number of protons in the nucleus
        \nEach element is characterized by a unique atomic number.

    <string name="AtomicNumber">
        The <font color="#9f2b00"><b>atomic number</b></font> is defined as the <font color="#9f2b00"><b>number of protons</b></font> found in the nucleus of an atom, which uniquely identifies its element.
        It is denoted by the symbol Z. Each element on the periodic table has its own unique atomic number,
        which is also referred to as the proton number.
    </string>

    <string name="MassNumber">The mass of an atom is mostly ascribed to a nucleus, which consists of protons and neutrons.
        The total number of protons and neutrons is called the mass number. Therefore, the mass number well approximates to
        the mass of an atom or molecule. Meanwhile, the number of protons is called an atomic number, which characterizes
        chemical features of the element.\n

        \nThe value of the mass number can be calculated with the following formula:\n
        \nMass number (A) = atomic number (Z) + number of neutrons (N).
        \nIncreasing the atomic number, the mass number increases.
</string>

    <string name="Isotopes">
        Atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons. Most elements exist naturally as mixtures of isotopes. Stable isotopes do not emit radiation, and unstable isotopes do emit radiation.\n

    </string>

    <string name="Ion">
        An ion is an atom or molecule that has gained or lost one or more electrons, resulting in a positive or negative charge.\n

        \nThe number of electrons gained or lost by an atom is related to its position in the periodic table. Atoms tend to gain or lose electrons to achieve the electron configuration of the nearest noble gas.\n

        \nThe atomic number of sodium Na is Z = 11 ‚áí 11 protons
        \nNa is neutral ‚áí 11 electrons

    </string>

    <string name="IonvsAnions">
        The loss of an electron from an atom or molecule results in the formation of a cation, which carries a net positive charge. Some examples of cations are:\n

        \nSodium ion (Na+)
        \nPotassium ion (K+)
        \nCalcium ion (Ca2+)
        \nMagnesium ion (Mg2+)\n

        \nAnions are negatively charged ions due to the gain of electrons, for this reason they are larger and heavier. The most common anions are those formed from nonmetals on the periodic table.\n

        \nCarbonate ion (CO32-)
        \nAmmonium ion (NH4+)
        \nSulfate ion (SO42-)
    </string>

    <string name="NamingIons">
        Monatomic cations:
        \nMonatomic cations are named by adding the word "ion" to the name of the element. For elements with multiple possible charges (especially the transition metals), Roman numerals are used to indicate the charge.\n

        \nMg2+ = magnesium ion
        \nFe2+ = iron(II) ion

    <string name="democritus">
        The <font color="#9f2b00"><b>Democritus</b></font> atomic model is one of the earliest known theories about the nature of matter. Democritus of Abdera, a Greek philosopher who lived around the 5th century BC, was one of the first to propose that everything in existence is composed of tiny, indivisible particles called "atoms" (from the Greek "√°-tomos," meaning "without division").\n

        \nDemocritus\' atomic model suggests that atoms are the smallest indivisible parts of matter, infinite in number, eternal, and uncreated. He believed the qualities of an object come from the types of atoms that compose it. Later, Epicurus and Lucretius refined and expanded on this theory, adding depth to its philosophical and scientific interpretation.\n

        \n<font color="#9f2b00"><b>Key Principles of Democritus\' Atomic Model</b></font>
        \nThe most important elements that define the atomic model proposed by Democritus are the following:

        \n‚Ä¢ Indivisibility of atoms
        \n‚Ä¢ Matter is composed of indivisible particles called atoms.\n


        \nThe Greek atomic theory is significant historically and philosophically, but it was not based on observations of nature, measurements, tests, or experiments. Instead, the Greeks used mathematics and reason almost exclusively when they wrote about physics. Because of the influence of Aristotle, who did not agree with Democritus and other proponents of atomic philosophy, this theory was basically ignored for nearly 2,000 years.
    </string>

    <string name="SOLIDSPHEREMODEL">
        The first scientific model of the atom was proposed by John Dalton in the early 19th century. Dalton described atoms as solid, indivisible spheres, similar to tiny billiard balls. His key ideas were:\n

        \n‚Ä¢ Atoms are the basic building blocks of matter.
        \n‚Ä¢ Each element is made of one type of atom.
        \n‚Ä¢ Atoms of different elements combine in fixed ratios to form compound.

    </string>

    <string name="AtomicTheory">
         The following are the main postulates of Dalton‚Äôs Atomic Theory;\n

        \n1. All matter is made up of tiny, indivisible particles called atoms.\n
        \n2. All atoms of a specific element are identical in mass, size, and other properties. However, atoms of different elements exhibit different properties and vary in mass and size.\n
        \n3. Atoms can neither be created nor destroyed. Furthermore, atoms cannot be divided into smaller particles.\n
        \n4. Atoms of different elements can combine with each other in fixed whole-number ratios in order to form compounds.\n
        \n5. Atoms can be rearranged, combined, or separated in chemical reactions.\n
    </string>
    
    <string name="SIGNIFICANCE">
        Dalton\'s atomic model was instrumental in the development of other key scientific theories, such as atomic orbital theory. It influenced the development of the periodic table of elements, which was organized by Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869, based on the relationship between the properties of elements and their atomic masses. This advance made it possible to classify elements in a consistent manner and to predict the properties of elements that had not yet been discovered.
    </string>

    <string name="LIMITATION">
        \n‚Ä¢ Dalton\‚Äôs atomic theory stated that atoms were indivisible. However, the discovery of subatomic particles (such as protons, electrons, and neutrons) disproved this postulate.\n

        \n‚Ä¢ According to Dalton, all atoms of an element have identical masses and densities. However, different isotopes of elements have different atomic masses.\n

        \n‚Ä¢ The theory states that the masses of the atoms of two different elements must differ. However, it is possible for two different elements to share the same mass number.\n

        \n‚Ä¢ Certain complex organic compounds do not feature simple ratios of constituent atoms.
    </string>

    <string name="CONCLUSION">
        Dalton\'s atomic theory marked the beginning of a new era in science. Although his model turned out to be simplified and incorrect, it laid the groundwork for a deeper understanding of atomic structure and the laws governing interactions between elements. Over time, atomic theory evolved as new discoveries were made. Models such as those of Rutherford , Bohr , and eventually other modern theories expanded our understanding of the atom.
    </string>

    <string name="plummMOdel">
        Thomson\'s <font color="#9f2b00"><b>plum pudding model</b></font> describes an atom as electrons embedded within a positively charged "cloud." This positive "soup" balances the electrons\' negative charges, keeping them stable. Electrons move freely but are pulled toward the center by the attractive force of the positive charge. It\'s an early theory before the discovery of atomic nuclei.
        
    </string>
    
    <string name="THOMSONPOSTULATES">
        J. J. Thomson\'s atomic model introduced several key postulates that sought to explain the observed properties of atoms at the time. Here are the key postulates and their features:\n

        \n1. Thomson postulated the existence of negatively charged subatomic particles, which were later identified as electrons.\n
        \n2. Thomson imagined the atom as a uniform sphere of positive charge, where the negatively charged electrons were embedded.\n
        \n3. According to Thomson\'s model, electrons were distributed uniformly throughout the positively charged sphere.\n
        \n4. Electrons were considered to be able to move freely within the positively charged sphere, which explained the stability of the atom.\n
        \n5. Thomson proposed that electrons rotated freely in ring-shaped orbits within the atom.
    </string>

    <string name="SIGNIFICANCEJJ">
        Thomson Atomic Model may have proven inaccurate, it was significant in advancing atomic theory and modern physics. It transformed subsequent research and experimentation. It challenged the idea that atoms are indivisible and unchangeable entities, a belief held by ancient philosophers. The model\‚Äôs acted as a source of inspiration for Niels Bohr, who developed his quantum model of the atom, successfully integrating classical and quantum mechanics.

    </string>

    <string name="LIMITATIONJJ">
        Thomson\‚Äôs atomic model had several limitations that were eventually overcome by further research and the experiments of various scientists later on. Some of the limitations of Thomson‚Äôs Atomic Model are:\n

        \n‚Ä¢ This model did not account for the presence of positively charged particles in the atom, which were later identified as protons by Ernest Rutherford.\n
        \n‚Ä¢ The model could not explain the results of the gold foil experiment conducted by Rutherford.\n
        \n‚Ä¢ The model could not explain the phenomenon of atomic spectra, which is the emission and absorption of specific wavelengths of light by atoms.\n
        \n‚Ä¢ The model did not explain the presence of Isotopes.\n

        \nDespite these limitations, Thomson\‚Äôs Atomic Model is an important step in the development of Atomic Theory and only after this theory, there came various theories that provide a better understanding of Atoms.

    </string>

    <string name="NUCLEARMODEL">
        According to Rutherford\‚Äôs Atomic Model, the positively charged particles and the majority of the mass of an atom were said to be concentrated in a small volume. He referred to this area of the atoms as the nucleus. Another idea put forward by Rutherford\‚Äôs model of an atom was that an atom‚Äôs nucleus should be surrounded by negatively charged electrons. Rutherford also suggested that the electrons circle the nucleus at the speed of light. He called these elliptical paths orbits.\n

        \nIn 1909, Ernest Rutherford and his team conducted the famous gold foil experiment. They fired alpha particles (positively charged particles) at a thin sheet of gold foil and expected the particles to pass straight through, as predicted by the plum pudding model.

    </string>

    <string name="FoilExp">
        Rutherford teamed up with his assistant, Hans Geiger and Ernst Marsden who was an undergraduate student working in Rutherford‚Äôs lab; conducted the ‚Äú<font color="#9f2b00"><b>Gold Foil Experiment</b></font>‚Äù also known as the Geiger-Marsden experiment. His idea was to probe the structure of Atoms by firing Œ±-particles or helium ions, at thin metal foils (Gold Foil).

    </string>

    <string name="Exp2nd">
        In this experiment, Rutherford used Gold Foil which was an extremely thin sheet and was bombarded with positively charged Œ±-particles. He used Œ±-particles because they are very energetic and are heavier than other particles. Lead container acted as a source for Œ±-particles. Since he thought that the atom had a pudding-like structure, with electrons and positively charged particles embedded in it, he expected that the Œ±-particles would just pass through.\n

        \nInstead he found that the Œ±-particles scattered through different angles. The scattered particles were detected by the fluorescent screen which emitted fluorescent spikes. He observed that most of the particles passed through the gold foil with very little deflection or no deflection at all. Few particles scattered at large angles. This experiment proved that the entire mass of an Atom is located at the center and was named <font color="#9f2b00"><b>Nucleus</b></font>.

    <string name="POSTULATES2">
        Here are the major postulates of Rutherford‚Äôs atomic model based on observations and conclusions of the gold foil experiment:\n

        \n1. Positively charged particles make up an atom.\n
        \n2. The electrons that surround an atom‚Äôs nucleus are negatively charged particles.\n
        \n3. Since electrons are negatively charged and the tightly packed nucleus is positively charged, an atom either has no net charge or is electrically neutral.

    <string name="LIMITATIONRuth">
        Rutherford\‚Äôs atomic model was experimentally successful and widely accepted by scientists. However, it was unable to explain certain critical aspects of atoms.\n

        \n‚Ä¢ Rutherford\'s model couldn\'t explain the atom\'s stability. His observations showed electrons moving at high speeds in circular orbits, which contradicted Maxwell\‚Äôs findings. Maxwell stated that accelerated charged particles emit electromagnetic radiation, meaning electrons should constantly emit radiation. Rutherford‚Äôs model did not account for this.\n
        \n‚Ä¢ Rutherford\‚Äôs atomic model is incomplete because it does not explain any arrangement of electrons in orbit.\n
        \n‚Ä¢ Rutherford model hypothesis was later debunked by the discovery of protons and neutrons.\n
        \n‚Ä¢ Rutherford thought electrons moved quickly in circular paths around the nucleus. However, later research showed that this idea was incorrect.

    <string name="PlanetaryModel">
        Each shell has a specific energy level, and electrons cannot exist outside of these orbits. The closer the shell is to the nucleus, the smaller the energy of that shell. For an electron to move to another shell it must absorb or release energy. The amount of energy absorbed or emitted is dependent on the difference in energy between the shells. The energy radiated by the electron while jumping from a higher atomic orbital to a lower atomic orbital.

    </string>

    <string name="BohrModel2">
    <i>The lithium Bohr model. Electrons (blue) orbit in circular shells around the nucleus (red)</i>
</string>

    <string name="BohrModel3">
    <i>When an electron moves to a smaller shell, it releases energy which we observe as light</i>
</string>

    <string name="POSTULATESBohr">
        The major postulates of Bohr‚Äôs Atomic Model are;\n

        \n1. In an atom, electrons revolve around the nucleus in some fixed circular orbits called shells.\n
        \n2. These shells are also called Stationary Orbits.\n
        \n3. Electrons while revolving in these orbits do not lose any energy. Also, each cell has a fixed energy associated with it.\n
        \n4. The energy of an electron revolving in a stationary orbit remains constant. Energy is emitted from an atom only when an electron jumps from the orbit of higher energy to the orbit having low energy.\n
        \n5. When an electron jumps from one energy level to another energy level it radiates energy.
    </string>

    <string name="HYDROGENATOM">The Bohr model of the hydrogen atom was the first atomic model to successfully explain the radiation spectra of atomic hydrogen. Niels Bohr introduced the atomic Hydrogen model in the year 1913. It holds a special place in history as it gave rise to quantum mechanics by introducing quantum theory.</string>

    <string name="SIGNIFICANCEBhor">
        Bohr was the first to discover that electrons travel in various orbits around the nucleus and that the amount of electrons in the valence shell may be used to define an element\'s characteristics. Bohr model and offer a more thorough comprehension of behavior of atoms and molecules.
    </string>
    
    <string name="LIMITATIONBohr">
        The Bohr model cannot explain the splitting of spectral lines when they are influenced by an electric field (Stark effect) and a magnetic field (Zeeman Effect). It did not explain how atoms can form molecules through chemical bonds.\n

        \n‚Ä¢ The electrons revolving around the nucleus are considered on a planar dimension in the Bohr plan.\n
        \n‚Ä¢ Inability to predict large-sized atoms and explain the spectrum of atoms with only two electrons, such as the helium atom.\n
        \n‚Ä¢ It violated Heisenberg‚Äôs Principle. This principle states that it is impossible to determine the precise position and momentum of electrons at the same time.
